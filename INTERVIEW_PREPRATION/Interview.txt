AOT
=====

1. AOT - ahead of time compilation.
2. AOT compilation is a process in which your angular application's code is compiled and optimized before it's delivered to the browser.
3. During AOT compilation, Angular templated are also compiled ahead of time into Javascript code.

Benefits of AOT:
	1. Faster Load Time: AOT Compiled applications tend to load faster because the browser doesn't need to spend time to compiling templates.
						Templated are already in the javascript form.
	
	2. Smaller bundle sizes: AOT eliminates the angular compiler and reduces the size of the final bundle, leading to smaller file sizes and improved 
							Performance.
	3. Template type checking: AOT includes enhanced template type checking, catching potential errors during compilation.
	4. Better Security: Since templates are precompiled, there's a reduced risk of template-related security vulnerabilites.
	
JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation:
	1. JIT compilation is the process where your angular application's code is compiled in the browser in runtime, Just before it's executed.
	2. During JIT Compilation, the angular templates are compiled in the browser, which can lead to slower initial loading time.
	
Benefits of JIT:

1.Development Convenience: JIT compilation simplifies the development process, as you can make changes to your code and see them reflected immediately without
							needing to recomplie.

2. Dynamically Generated Templates: JIT allows the generation of dynamic templates, such as those created based on user input or data fetched from API's.
3. Better for Rapid Prototyping: In development or rapid prototyping scenarios, JIT’s quicker turnaround time can be advantageous.

-> AOT is often preferred for production environments because of its advantages in terms of load times, 
bundle size, and template type checking. 
-> It’s the default compilation mode for Angular applications.
-> JIT, on the other hand, is useful during development due to its rapid iteration capabilities. 
-> Developers can make code changes and immediately see the results without the need for a separate build step. 
-> However, JIT-compiled applications might have slightly slower initial load times and larger bundle sizes compared to AOT-compiled applications.
